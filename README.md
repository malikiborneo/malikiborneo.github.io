## Setup & Customization

This portfolio is designed to be easily customizable. To use this template for your own portfolio:

1.  **Fork this Repository (Optional):** If you're viewing this on GitHub.
2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)

3.  **Customize `index.html`:**
    * **Personal Information:** Update the "About Me" section, experience, project details, skills, education, and contact information with your own.
    * **Images:** Replace placeholder images (profile picture, project screenshots) with your actual images. Place your images in an `assets` or `img` folder (you might need to create one) and update the `src` attributes in the HTML.
    * **Links:** Update all placeholder links (`#`, social media links, project links) to point to your resources.
    * **Color Theme (Optional):** The theme is defined using Tailwind CSS utility classes directly in the HTML and within the `<style>` block in the `<head>`. You can modify these classes to change colors, fonts, etc. Refer to the [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) for class references.
4.  **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
    * If your repository is named `your-username.github.io`, the site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io`.
    * If it's another repository name (e.g., `my-portfolio`), go to your repository settings on GitHub, navigate to the "Pages" section, select the branch to deploy from (usually `main` or `master`), choose the `/ (root)` folder, and save. Your site will be available at `https://your-username.github.io/my-portfolio/`.

## How to Replace Placeholder Images

* **Hero Profile Picture:**
    Search for:
    ```html
    <img src="[https://placehold.co/150x150/FFFFFF/4299E1?text=RMA](https://placehold.co/150x150/FFFFFF/4299E1?text=RMA)" alt="Reza Maliki Akbar" ...>
    ```
    Replace `https://placehold.co/150x150/FFFFFF/4299E1?text=RMA` with the path to your profile picture.

* **Project Card Images:**
    Search for image tags within the `project-card` divs, for example:
    ```html
    <img src="[https://placehold.co/600x400/1E293B/93C5FD?text=IoT+CyberSec](https://placehold.co/600x400/1E293B/93C5FD?text=IoT+CyberSec)" alt="IoT Cybersecurity Project" ...>
    ```
    Replace the `src` with the path to your project screenshot. Ensure your images are appropriately sized or use CSS/Tailwind classes to manage their display.
